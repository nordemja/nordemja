### HelloðŸ‘‹

My name is Justin Nordeman and I am an experienced, results-driven data engineer. I spent 3 years at 84.51Â°, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kroger, working on high-priority projects. One of my key contributions was helping to develop an interactive data science platform providing secure access to data from 60M+ U.S. households to 12 of the world's leading CPG brands-enabling better, actionable insights.

I have a passion for baseball âš¾ and am always looking to improve current insights in the sport.
